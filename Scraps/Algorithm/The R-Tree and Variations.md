The R-Tree and Variations

The R-tree structure has been proposed in 1984 by Guttman to efficiently manipulate rectangles in VLSI chip design. This work influenced many researchers towards the application of the structure for other purposes as well. During the last twenty years many variations of the original structure have been proposed to either improve the performance of spatial queries, or to enable the application of the structure to different contexts. Among the most widely accepted R-tree variants are the R+-tree, the R-tree and the Hilbert R-tree. If the dataset is known in advance, more efficient (static) structures can be constructed resulting in considerable performance improvement. The query processing capabilities of the structure have been thoroughly studied in the literature, resulting in efficient algorithms for spatial and spatiotemporal query processing. Recently, the structure has been adopted for query processing purposes in emerging application domains such as OLAP, data warehouses and data mining.
