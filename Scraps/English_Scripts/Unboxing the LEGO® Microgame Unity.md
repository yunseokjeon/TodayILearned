Unboxing the LEGOÂ® Microgame | Unity

https://youtu.be/18OwJ07u_bo

[NARRATOR] The Lego Microgame is your gateway into game development.
We created this 3D Lego world that allows you to create
your own web-based game using Lego Behavior Bricks.
We'll touch on what these are and what you can do with them later on.
In this video, I'm going to show you where you can get Unity,
which is one of the world's leading real-time 3D engines,
and other basic steps to help you get started
with your own version of our Lego Microgame.
Getting Unity: First, you need to download and install Unity.
Click on the link in the description box below
that will lead you to our download page.
We want to follow the guided learning path
so we click on Get Started to start the download.
Once the download is complete, you can install the Unity Hub
like any other program.
In the Unity Hub, you need to install Unity version 2019.4,
which you can do by clicking on Install.
The Hub will now continue the download and installation process
in the background, while you create your Unity ID.
Now you can select between all of our different microgames.
In our case, I'm going to select the Lego Micrograme
and click on Continue.
Once Unity is successfully installed,
a Launch button will appear in the Unity Hub.
Select, press it, and jump into the Unity Editor.
Getting Started with the Tutorials.
Once the Editor opens up, we will see a pop-up
that asks us to choose whether we want to explore on our own,
or start the tutorials, which are all displayed here.
If you select Start Tutorials,
you will automatically start with the first tutorial.
This tutorial introduces us to the Scene view,
which is this part here.
This is where we can navigate our Scene while developing.
If we enter Play mode, the view will automatically switch
to the Game view, which is allowing us to test our game.
In Play Mode, I can rotate the view using the mouse,
and I can walk around by using the W, A, S and D keys,
or the arrow keys on my keyboard.
I can also use the space bar to jump.
After testing the controls, I can press Play one more time
to leave Play Mode and continue development.
After you finish the tutorial you can click Done,
and you will automatically return back
to this overview of all the tutorials.
Make it your own. The other tutorials will explain
how you can add platforms, activate the elevator,
change the wind conditions, add enemies
and customize your game.
You can find additional instructions and ideas
on how to customize your game
in the Lego Microgame Creative Mod section on our website.
which is, of course, linked in the description box down below.
If you follow the tutorial and the creative mods,
you should end up with your very own version
of the Lego Microgame just like I did.

Build and share your game.
As a last step, you can now build your game and publish it
to share it with your friends.
To do that, you navigate to Publish > WebGL Project.
In this pop-up, we click on Create New WebGL Build.
Your explorer will appear and ask you to select a folder.
After you've selected the folder,
Unity will make a build of your game for you,
and this might take a few minutes.
Once your build is done, you can press on Publish
to upload your build to your Unity profile.
In your browser, you will be asked to edit Title and Description,
and an image of your game.
Once you are done, you can share the link to your game with your friends
and have them try out your Lego Microgame
right in the browser window.
If you want to try my version of the Lego Microgame,
there's a link to it in the description box down below.
If you enjoyed this video, I invite you to join us
