The two primary benefits are reach and performance.

C++ runs everywhere â€“ Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, and in browser. It gives you access to the hardware and OS on all platforms. It is well supported and standardized, with few discrepancies between implementations. C++ allows us to build high-performance libraries that can be used anywhere.

As energy costs increasingly drive the costs of computing and the limits of performance, the efficiency of C++ has drawn developers from all domains. C++ is at the forefront of computing and research.
