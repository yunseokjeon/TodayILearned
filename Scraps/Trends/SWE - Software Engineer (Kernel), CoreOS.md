## Description

Description
The CoreOS team is responsible for the development of new kernel and systems features on all products, as well as evolving our software for new ARM & Intel platforms to contribute to the success of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac product lines. CoreOS works with many teams across the company to provide a stable, fast, and high-quality foundation on which iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS frameworks and applications can be developed.

We're looking for a self-motivated engineer with the desire to learn and develop technical expertise and leadership. Working on core technologies for macOS and iOS, you will have the opportunity to have a major impact on the design and implementation of Apple's consumer products. Our environment fosters product innovation, rapid product iteration, and a liberating amount of autonomy.

You'll have the chance to learn or develop your knowledge in operating systems internals, hardware architecture, and assembly programming; Swift or Objective-C; scripting languages; lldb and DTrace.

Based in Prague, we work closely with teams across Apple worldwide. This means evening meetings with teams outside the Czech Republic and limited international travel may be required in the future.

If this is you, we'd love to hear from you!
