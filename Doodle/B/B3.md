580. Count Student Number in Departments

Here is an example input:

student table:
| student_id | student_name | gender | dept_id |
|------------|--------------|--------|---------|
| 1          | Jack         | M      | 1       |
| 2          | Jane         | F      | 1       |
| 3          | Mark         | M      | 2       |

department table:
| dept_id | dept_name   |
|---------|-------------|
| 1       | Engineering |
| 2       | Science     |
| 3       | Law         |

The Output should be:
| dept_name   | student_number |
|-------------|----------------|
| Engineering | 2              |
| Science     | 1              |
| Law         | 0              |

SELECT
    dept_name, COUNT(student_id) AS student_number
FROM
    department
        LEFT JOIN
    student ON department.dept_id = student.dept_id
GROUP BY department.dept_name
ORDER BY student_number DESC;

585. Investments in 2016

Sample Input

| PID | TIV_2015 | TIV_2016 | LAT | LON |
|-----|----------|----------|-----|-----|
| 1   | 10       | 5        | 10  | 10  |

| 4   | 10       | 40       | 40  | 40  |

Sample Output

| TIV_2016 |
|----------|
| 45.00    |

Explanation

The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.
The TIV_2015 value '10' is as the same as the third and forth record, and its location unique.

The second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its TIV_2015 is not like any other policyholders.

And its location is the same with the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.

So, the result is the sum of TIV_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.
