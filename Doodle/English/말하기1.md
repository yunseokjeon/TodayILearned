In 1957, the Soviet Union launched a satellite called Sputnik 1 into Earth's orbit. This was the first satellite to be sent into space. The Space Race was on! The United States began funding NASA to compete with the Soviet Union. The United States wanted to be the first country to have a successful human space flight. Katherine G. Johnson contributed greatly to this effort. She wrote research papers that laid out many of the mathematical equations necessary for space travel.

Politicians and other groups have been debating over abortion for a very long time. The U.S. has two main political groups. They are the Democrats and the Republicans. In general, many Democratic politicians tend to support abortion rights. Many Republican politicians tend to support the idea that abortion should be a decision that's up to state governments to decide. Some Republican politicians say that abortion is morally wrong.

The Bank of Korea raised the rate by a quarter percentage point in May, the fifth in a round of monetary tightening that began last year. The monetary policy board is projected to increase rates by a historic 50 basis points to 2.25 percent at the Wednesday meeting, according to Reuters poll Monday.

Bank of Korea's central banker has repeatedly said that the current focus is inflation, which was 6 percent in June. That is the highest since the 6.8 percent jump in November 1988, when Korea was in the midst of the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

Programming-related jobs have high rates of skill turnover. Over time, the types of skills required by companies hiring software developers change more rapidly than any other profession.

To demonstrate this, researchers analyzed job postings on more than 40,000 online job boards and company websites between 2007 and 2019, controlling for employer, location, and occupation. They defined "new" skills as those that were rare or non-existent in 2007 but prevalent in 2019 and "old" skills as those that were prevalent in 2007 but rare or extinct in 2019.

Plastic sports bottles shed hundreds of chemicals into the water they hold, a new study finds. The containers release even more pollutants after being run through a dishwasher. Although some of the chemicals might be harmful, no one knows whether there's any health risk from the amounts that end up in the water.

For years scientists knew that chemicals can leach out of plastic. Some of those chemicals are toxic. Manufacturers have removed some of the more worrisome chemicals, such as bisphenol A (BPA), from plastic products, such as water bottles. But scientists know little about what other chemicals might leave these products.

There are many reasons why people leave their home countries. Some people may be looking for better employment. Some might want to explore new parts of the world, or to raise their families elsewhere. Others may move to pursue exciting educational opportunities. This type of voluntary movement from one country to another is called immigration. A person who chooses to move from one country to another to live there permanently is called an immigrant.

Unlike immigrants, some people are forced to leave their home country because of persecution, violence, or war in their home country. These people are called refugees, and they are worried about their safety. To protect themselves, refugees must flee from their home country and resettle in another one. Usually, refugees cannot return to their home countries after they leave because it is unsafe. This is another important difference between refugees and immigrants, as immigrants may return to their home countries if they want to and are able. The last important difference between refugees and immigrants is that refugees cannot be sent back to the country they are fleeing from. Immigrants, however, are subject to their new countryâ€™s immigration laws. This means immigrants can be turned away from entering a new country.
