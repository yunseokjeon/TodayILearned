In 1957, the Soviet Union launched a satellite called Sputnik 1 into Earth's orbit. This was the first satellite to be sent into space. The Space Race was on! The United States began funding NASA to compete with the Soviet Union. The United States wanted to be the first country to have a successful human space flight. Katherine G. Johnson contributed greatly to this effort. She wrote research papers that laid out many of the mathematical equations necessary for space travel.

Katherine G. Johnson is probably most known for her work on the orbital mission of John Glenn. He was set to be the first American to orbit around the Earth. But he did not trust all of the electronic machines that would control the path of his spaceship. These machines would sometimes malfunction. Glenn asked the engineers for Katherine G. Johnson’s help. He trusted her to check every single mathematical equation. She checked the numbers, and Glenn’s mission was a success! Now, there is a movie called Hidden Figures that tells the true story of how she and two other brilliant African American women made sure this mission was a triumph.

U.S. Speaker Nancy Pelosi's Asia tour upped the pressure on Korea to join "Chip 4."

She met with TSMC Chairman Mark Liu while in Taipei but did not visit Korean chipmakers.

It has been reported that the Joe Biden administration has proposed a semiconductor supply alliance to Korea, Taiwan and Japan in March with an August deadline for making a commitment.

"Speaker Pelosi's visit indicates that the time for Korea to choose has neared," said People Power Party legislator Ahn Cheol-soo in a Facebook post titled "Joining Chip 4 is an offer one can't refuse" — alluding to "The Godfather" — on Thursday.

Ahn, who is a doctor, start-up CEO and a former presidential candidate, stressed that the sole purpose of Pelosi's trip is the last three stops — Taiwan, No. 1 in foundry, Korea, No. 1 in memory chips, and Japan, No.1 semiconductor equipment.

"Our biggest concern is the opposition from China, which took 60 percent of semiconductor exports last year," Ahn noted. "That's why our decision is harder than for the U.S., Japan and Taiwan."

Noting that the meeting between Pelosi and Liu is significant, Ahn stressed that Korea has to look at the situation objectively.

"The United States has the most patents in semiconductors and their technology especially in design is unparalleled," Ahn noted. "Japan has the best source technology in materials, parts and equipment.

"While we are the world's strongest in memory semiconductors, we have to face the fact that this is has been achieved through ecosystem symbiosis with the U.S. and Japan."

He said the national loss will be great if Korea refuses to join the Chip 4.
