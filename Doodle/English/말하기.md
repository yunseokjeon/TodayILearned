Politicians and other groups have been debating over abortion for a very long time. The U.S. has two main political groups. They are the Democrats and the Republicans. In general, many Democratic politicians tend to support abortion rights. Many Republican politicians tend to support the idea that abortion should be a decision that's up to state governments to decide. Some Republican politicians say that abortion is morally wrong.

The Bank of Korea raised the rate by a quarter percentage point in May, the fifth in a round of monetary tightening that began last year. The monetary policy board is projected to increase rates by a historic 50 basis points to 2.25 percent at the Wednesday meeting, according to Reuters poll Monday.

Bank of Korea's central banker has repeatedly said that the current focus is inflation, which was 6 percent in June. That is the highest since the 6.8 percent jump in November 1988, when Korea was in the midst of the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

Programming-related jobs have high rates of skill turnover. Over time, the types of skills required by companies hiring software developers change more rapidly than any other profession.

To demonstrate this, researchers analyzed job postings on more than 40,000 online job boards and company websites between 2007 and 2019, controlling for employer, location, and occupation. They defined "new" skills as those that were rare or non-existent in 2007 but prevalent in 2019 and "old" skills as those that were prevalent in 2007 but rare or extinct in 2019.
