Windows is the most open platform on the planet for creators. Part of living our commitment to openness is welcoming partner technologies and content that deliver powerful experiences. And what makes Windows, well, Windows is the variety of apps available. So, with Windows 11, we announced a new Microsoft Store to showcase the best experiences from developers, a flexible and transparent commerce model, and the introduction of Androidâ„¢ apps.

Today, we are announcing the first preview of our Android apps experience into the Windows Insider Program. We are proud to deliver this experience with our partners â€“ Amazon and Intel â€“ to Beta Channel users in the United States on eligible devices running Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm platforms.

What makes Spring so popular?

Spring is, by far, the most popular framework for application development in the Java ecosystem. By a wide margin. The reason is actually quite simple â€“ it does a lot of things right, and it's getting better and better with each release.

There aren't a lot of technologies with the kind of wide reach, stability and maturity of Spring, that still move fast and innovate. That's a really tough balance to hit, and Spring has been hitting it for over a decade.

Today, Spring, along with Boot, is a polished, modern and highly expressive framework, easily passing the Twitter test. That's where you can actually fit useful functionality into a single tweet ðŸ™‚

So, the popularity of the Spring ecosystem is well deserved. If you're working in Java, you're very likely doing work with Spring.
