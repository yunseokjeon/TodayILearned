Flutter is changing the world by bringing fast, natively compiled software to the masses. This allows indie developers to release applications for every platform in the same time it would usually have taken a software company. Itâ€™s only natural that game developers want to take advantage of that, too.

If only there were a way to develop beautiful native games without all the bloat. Thatâ€™s where Flame comes in.
